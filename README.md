# Remote-Control-Car
This project involves using an Arduino microcontroller programmed in C to create a blind man stick that can detect obstacles and provide tactile feedback to the user. Ultrasonic sensors detect the distance to objects, and the micro-controller activates a buzzer in the handle of the stick to indicate the presence and location of obstacles.
