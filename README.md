# Remote-Control-Car
I built a remote-controlled car using an ESP32 and Blynk app, which can be controlled using a smartphone. I implemented the project in both C and MicroPython, making it more accessible to users. The ESP32 allows for real-time communication with the app over Wi-Fi. I'm proud of the project, as it combines my passion for technology and DIY projects. I look forward to exploring more possibilities with the ESP32 and Blynk, and hope to inspire others to do the same.
